					Did some throwing today! I tried another timelapse but it ended up blurry T-T. Most of my time this session went in trimming the 
                    other pots from the previous session, This was the last chunk of clay I had saved for trimming that I used to do a final throw!

						I got to pick a two sets of pots! My pet pots (that's what I call them now lol) and  the last set of red
						clay. Since the red pots were a little too dry for trimming, I decided to use them to test some new glazes. I 
						actually really like the white glaze on the red clay, I was not expecting speckles! The Macadamia (yellow) has
						always been a wild card; I do like how it looks here (sometimes it gives a more glossy finish). I didn't try lighter
						glazes on the red until now, but I'll start giving it a shot a more!

						I want to spotlight this pup-pot! I love him so much. I think the studio got a better clear glaze because its feel is almost
						buttery; really nice. It's also the perfect size for my Jade plant! I'll be a making more of these, I think when I get the 
						chance to have a market, I'd love to sell stuff like this!

					I didn't take a picture of all the things I trimmed. I was focused on the jars though! I am excited for the garlic
					jar, I am planning to use the white glaze I just tested! The top doesn't really slot in, I'll have to try more to 
					get a better hang of it. This time remembered to add a vent to the egg maker!

					And finally, I had an awkward amount of clay left after trimming so I decided to throw it! I did not weigh it, but 
					I think it was atleast 1.5Kg! It's also tall and didn't collapse! woop woop!

					Unfortunately my last batch got a bit too dry for trimming. I had to throw out the plate.
					The rest of the pots got a very basic clean up trim. They are now going through the firing cycles! I forgot to take a picture of the trimmed shapes..

						I started a new session of throwing. Similar goals as last time: throw some new stuff and some big stuff. I pushed the clay weight even more: got up to 1.5KG BAYBEE.
						The plate in the back right is the heaviest I've thrown.

						I probably could have thrown bigger with that amount of clay but honestly just happy I was able to center that quickly and
						end with some not-collapsed shape.

						I've gotten a better hang of closed forms too! My goal with this one is to make a garlic jar. I also made a lid for a second attempt for an egg maker (the last one I made was too small and I forgot to add a vent).
