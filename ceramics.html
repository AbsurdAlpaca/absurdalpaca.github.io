						I got to pick up my set of glazes I mentioned on Jan 25th! THEY LOOK SO GOOD!! I am very happy with the mugs. I now have a set! 
						There is a flaw where some of the rims are not perfectly round because they got deformed when moving them from the wheel. 
					</p>
					<p> 
						When glazing these I wanted to make sure I show more of the raw red clay. I love every piece that came out of this glaze, 
						If I make more they will be gifts!

						I also started a new session of throwing. A few new challenges to push my skills. I want to be able to throw bigger. 
						So this time I started throwing with clayy 800-900g (I want slowly work my self to 2kg).
					</p>
					<p> 
						After 4 fairly successful larger throws, i tried speed throwing! went back to ~500g and tried to throw as fast as possible. 
						I had more failures here. All of them collapsed at some point. Only 2 made it to some workable form. Maybe I need to go slower next time haha.
					</p>	
					<p> 
						I also threw one plate so I can replace the one sub-par one we have been using at home. I'm am unsure if this one is too thin.. 
						we will find out! Ideally I will get a set of 6.. I keep managing to procastinate these

			<p>It was a really gorgeous day today. I loved the sunlight coming through the window right on my wheel.</p>
			<p>It was still freezing (-2C), but since today's goal was trimming, I didnt need to deal with water much!</p>

						I decided to make a new puppy planter with the round pot. I love the Pep one i made last year, and wanted to build on that. the base was a little too thin to trim a 
						a pretty base so i ended up with a rounded-wobbly base. I decided to try putting on little feet for the first time! I still think it is wobbly but atleast there are little foots!
					</p>
					<p> 
						I have a friends birthday who has a dog and love plants so i was planning to make this for her. 
						But.. i love this alot T-T so I am going to try and make another one for both of us lol.

						This the result of today's trim session. Most of the time was with the puppy planter. the small mug will be for more glaze testing. I was hoping the big pot i made could replace our current container for cooking spatulas but the end result is going to be too small.
						next time i got to go even bigger!

					<p>Threw these pots at home after I stupidly managed to scrape the knuckles on my right hand. Turns out I really need those while throwing! Also IT'S FREEZING. THE CLAY FROZE. I am boiling water and using that to throw and still end up with extremely cold water within minutes. I am still trying to figure out a good clay reclaim process for my home studio. It is so much harder when it is so cold that the water does not leave clay reclaim. I may reduce throwing at home until tempratures increase T-T</p>
					<p> I threw these with the intention of having some more glaze experiments. No idea how much I threw with. I think the largest pot here is a new weight best!</p>

					<p>Threw these pots after a long end of year gap and also recovering from covid (great start to the year..). I timed myself for these, 7 pots of within 2hrs! New personal best. I really liked a wide 16oz mug I made a month ago so my goal here was to make some more similar to that. Hopefully I'll have a set of 4 for myself and then I can make more as gifts (and maybe a sale some point in the future??). </p>
					<p>I am also experimenting with bowl shapes for different purposes. Currently trying for the perfect cereal&milk bowl and the perfect ramen bowl.</p>

					<p>I got to pick up some pots I set to glaze fire earlier in the week. These were thrown back in early december and I didn't have the chance to glaze them until after holiday madness. I was excited for these because they used some new glazes I bought for myself: Green Tea, Alabaster, Capri Blue and Sea Salt.</p>	
					<p>Mostly underwhelmed by the outcome. I was expecting some cooler movement in the glazes based on what I had found online. These ended up a little dull and the texture is not glossy at all. My first guess is that I did not use enough glaze and need more. If that doesnt work I may end up buying a kiln to experiment with firing..</p>
