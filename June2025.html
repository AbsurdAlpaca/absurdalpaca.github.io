							All of these are glazes that I bought myself. I started deviating from the studio glazes now. 
							I am still testing testing with layering colors I liked with Honey Flux.
							Some new favorites are:
						</p>
						<p class="hideable">
							Norse Blue: very bright light blue. When layered with Honey flux it creates a lot of ocean waves like feel
						</p>
						<p class="hideable">
							Chun Plum: a beautiful deep purple that creates these pretty deep purple streaks in white when 
							layered with Honey Flux.
						</p>
						<p class="hideable">
							After the last few months of testing glazes I think I found some styles that I like and will move to making sure future glazes I get
							match these (at least for now!)

						The two flower pots used the classic clear and shadow green glazes from the studio. But they turned out really different; 
						the clear is superr foggy and the shadow green was clear for a lot of the covering. 
						I feel like something was off with the kiln gods, since I have used those studio glazes the most. 
						It anyway worked out since they look pretty holding the plants I made them for!

							I also got a new bag of fools gold and threw the entire bag this month too. 
							I did not take pics of everything but I am trying to make more plates (and blates?) for myself.

							Another fun project I have wanted is to make a set of mugs as a gift! I am excited for these;

					Finally, some timelapses! I want to try make some functional pottery that does not have to do with dinnerware.
					The first video is going to be a soap dispenser! I like the shape, hopefully the hole is big enough for the dispensing part!

				<p class="hideable">
					Finally, some timelapses! The second thing I have been trying to do is actually have a clay reclaim system. I haven't disposed any of the
					clay i have at home and finally got it to be usable. I decided to use the entire amount I got prepared for this big boy. It will be a flower pot!
					Curious how it will turn out, probably a disaster? I haven't enjoyed the reclaim process so far, so lets see how long this commitment lasts.
