		<h3> Glaze Results </h3>

				I did not have much to pick up from the firings this month. The studio kiln is BUSY. The racks are full and everyone
				is prepping for the holidays so things are much slower at getting to the finished state. I was hoping to gift a mug
				set for Thanksgiving but it was taking so long it will now be a Christmas gift (hopefully).
			</p>
			<p class="hideable">
				What I was able to pick was pretty awesome though. These are some bigger bowls I have been working on.

				This bowl has been sitting on my bisque shelf for MONTHS. Looking back in this blog, it was thrown in June!!
				I have wanted to get this bowl to have the northern lights/space-y look so it has been sitting until I finally found
				a combo that worked.

					I am finally able to get off work at well before dinner! So my secondary hobby is back in action; cooking new things!
					I have been restricted to all my quick and dirty dinners for the past couple months so I have a huge list of new recipes
					I have been waiting to try (and serve with my new pots!)

		<h3> Glaze Prep </h3>

						I started some new glaze ideas on my pile of unglazed pots. The strawberry bowl gave me motivation to try
						making some pieces with actual art on it. These are the two I am most excited for now! 
					</p>
					<p class="hideable">
						This process takes much longer than the usual because I do an additional bisque fire after painting on 
						the stroke and coat to prevent it from smudgeing into the clear glazes.

							I got more of the speckled clay to work with! this is a new gift set underway, I am hoping to gift
							a set of mugs that have very beachy-seaside vibe to it. There were some results from the last month 
							of testing that made me feel like I can make a very pretty set. 
						</p>

							I have one more round of tests going through the glaze tests before I finalize how I want to glaze these,
