						On Halloween, I put them out on the frontyard, kinda small but I want to make more every year. Maybe more 
						expressive ones as I get better at throwing closed forms. It was a rainy day, but I loved them!

				<h3> Glaze Prep </h3>
				<p class="hideable">
					I still had quite a bit of work this month so I could not spend too much time at the studio. But since I had 
					so many bisqued pots waiting since July, I could take breaks and moments of downtime for glazing pots. I had some new glazes arrive recently, 
					I got some Amaco ones! I also bought some thin masking tape to level up my glazing quality. It should make some very clean lines when glazing.

				<div class="inline-container">

						<p class="hideable">
							This first one is a test plate for Fool's Gold. The outer ring is specifically testing how this clay reacts to 
							glazes under Spectrum Floating Pearl White. The inner circle is for glazes under Amaco Oatmeal. 
						</p>
						<p class="hideable">
							Both are new flux glazes for me that I want to try now that I have an understanding on HoneyFlux. 
							The inner circle has some three glaze layers, havent tried it yet but I am excited to try it out!

							This test piece is for seeing how Spectrum Pearl White reacts on top of glazes on Bmix clay. I have noticed the 
							results on Bmix and porcelain are pretty similar. Porcelain just feels way softer and smoother when fully fired. 
						</p>

						<p class="hideable">
							I am using pretty much all the colorful glazes I have liked so far. The goal is to compare it with Honey Flux results 
							to see how I should be picking my flux glazes.

							The plum black vase is a test I did not take a picture of. Its a test with Obsidian, Blue Hydrangea and some

		<h3> Throwing and Trimming </h3>

			<div> 
				<p class="hideable">
					I mentioned this earlier, but I only had time to go to the studio twice, one throwing and one trimming session. 
					I just HAD to try the new speckled clay available at the studio. I also noticed, I have gotten really fast! I am
					able to throw a pretty much half a bag every session. The speckled clay looks so awesome I have so much to try with it.
					This bowl is pretty big! over 5 pounds~ I am hoping to make a pretty fruit bowl out of it.
