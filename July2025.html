						These two are probably my favorite from the bunch. They are new glazes I got! Spectrum floating glazes (ooOOooO). They
						are such bright colors and mix with each other really well. I love both of these A LOT. The soap dispenser could be a better
						in throw quality, the piece dried too much so i could not trim it well, it has a bit of a wobbly base. But the texture and look
						of the piece is amazing. That one is Alabaster under all the spectrum floats, instead of my usual honey flux. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<p class="hideable">
					The rest are my own pieces that i had thrown a while back but didnt want to glaze until i got all that testing completed. The spacey look
					is actually Blue Hydrangea, IT'S SO GOOD ON DARK CLAY. It also layers very well, Eggplant+BlueHydrangea on plum black is very pretty.

		<h3> Raku Firing </h3>
			<div class="entry">
				<div> 
					<p class="hideable">
						I tried something super new this month! It's a new firing technique called "Raku". Instead of the usual electric kiln and glazes
						I took a few of my pots to a workshop where I had to use special raku glazes and firing. It was super cool to see how different metals 
						react to reduction firing. I am not sure if i will do it often, since it is not food safe, but I will love to try it every once in a while!					</p>
					<div class="inline-container">

					</div>
					<p class="hideable">
						These are not all my pieces, a lot of these are other results from the workshop, they all looked so amazing and are a 
						spretty good representation on how this firing looks.

		<h3> Throwing and Trimming </h3>
		<div class="entry">
			<div class="inline-container"> 
				<div>
					<p class="hideable">
						I finished up this month with one throw session! Started using a new bag of clay! This one is Laguna Bmix, its a white clay thats a
						bit more porcelein-esque than the usual seamix I have been using. It throws so smoooth in comparison, I had a lot of fun with it! 
						I want to see how it throws so I just threw some funky shapes.
					</p>
					<p class="hideable">
						The piece I am most excited for is the ring holder. I haven't made it before and I want to be able to gift one soon!
