                        Over the past couple days I was glazing my latest set of porceein pots. Weirdly, I didnt take any photos of 
                        the throwing/trimming process?? so yup, at some point in the last couple weeks I did throw these lol
					</p>
                    <p class="hideable">
                        I also got one more new glaze ~Honey Flux~. It is supposed to make everything look EVEN COOLER so I did some tests with that glaze with my less favorite pots here.
					</p>
                    <p class="hideable">
                        The plate up front is layered with 3 coats honey flux and then 2 layers of (from outside to inside): Green Tea (yep I'm trying it again), Blue Hydrangea, Capri Blue (also making a comeback) 
					</p>
                    <p class="hideable">
                        There are a couple of other test mugs that use Honey Flux as a base and various of my other glazes layered on top. Cautiously optimistic that they will look cool! I realllly
                        want the Pink Coral to look cool with Honey Flux. Super exited to see how that turns out.

                        I threw these over a week ago and was very worried I'd have to throw them out. But I got lucky! They were tad on the dry side but I could trim them just fine!
                        The only thing I couldn't do is add holes to the big bowl. I was planning to make that into a "berry bowl". But now its just a big bowl lol

					Over the next week I was mostly just stopping at the studio to try and pick up my glazes pots when possible. 
                    I threw an occasional pot or two but nothing too impressive. I also mostly forgot to take pictures because I would 
                    rush home after cleaning up at the studio (rip).

					All of the glazes here ended up as successes!! I love how all the Fool's Gold pieces ended up. The the speckels just make it look so classy. 
                    And from the colors, the plate turned out as good as I can possibly hope it to be. The smaller semi-transparents pots ended up a little patchy and weirdly the cerulean bowl
                    got some pinholing. I wonder if that is the difference from Porcelein and Seamix. I'll be glazing my next set in porcelein so we'll find out!

                Got a big haul of glaze and bisque fires today! I'm actually impressed at how I like ALL of them. I tested on Porcelein and Fool's Gold. 
                My goal was to get some bright spring-y colors since a lot of my things lately
                have dark browns and greens. I love those colors, but I still wanted something for the upcoming
                season.

                        Blue Splatterware: looks really cool but I am 
                        not a fan of the texture; very matte. Which just doesnt seem great when it comes to handling 
                        foods. I am going to try layering some glossy glazes over it in the future for better textures 
                        and maybe even a new spotty look too.
					</p>
                    <p class="hideable">
                        Blue Hydrangea: HUGE FAN. not visible in the 
                        photo but the glaze has these gorgeous little yellow and white specks on them too. Its also translucent
                        so will be trying this glaze as a top layer in the future too! 
					</p>
                    <p class="hideable">
                        Deep Olive Green: I'm neutral. The glaze is shockingly stinky? I like have this cool colored green
                        as an option though. 
					</p>
                    <p class="hideable">
                        Living Coral: I LOVE this one. It's not visible in the camera but the texture is espcially nice. The glaze also
                        has a very pretty spotting on it that makes it feel textured. 
					</p>
                    <p class="hideable">
                        Semi-Transparent Cerulean and Orchid: These turned out amazing too. Just love the pastel colors and the glossy finish feels very good!

                        This image are the same glazes mentioned above but on Fool's Gold.

                    <p class="hideable">
                        Overall, I think these glazes aren't that great on Fool's Gold. I think I liked Blue Splatterware and the 
                        Pink Coral the most. The semi-transparent glazes were OK, but I think the cool color glazes didn't mesh with the 
                        warm colored clay.

						So, with all these test tiles I decided what to paint my batch of (Seamix) white pots! They may end up slightly differnt 
                        but probably close enough. The Fools Gold Pots in the corner are just going to get a transparent/white glaze from the studio now. 
                        I want to test those out as well and I think those will be prettier on Fool's Gold.
