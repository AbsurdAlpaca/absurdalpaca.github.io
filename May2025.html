               The weather was perfect, so i took my wheel out and threw in the backyard today. Felt so in my element and had a ton of fun! Pep had a great time too

				This is also some leftover porcelein I've had hanging out for a couple months, so my goal to finish it up.
				It was a warm day out so the porcelein was drying incredibly fast. By the time I finished 4 pots, I could start trimming them!

						One new thing I tried was throwing off the hump. I tried it once last october in attempt to make a lot of Diwali Diyas but it was a total failure. 
						I had a rough start here too but started to get a hang of it.
					</p>
					<p class="hideable"> Weirdly, the hardest part isn't centering but the final step of cutting off the pot. It's not
						very noticable in this timelapse but everytime I cut off a finished pot it's a bit of a miracle I did not destroy it. I feel like it would be super fun when 
						I get a better hang of it, so I'll definitely be trying more often. These pieces are gonna be perfect candidates for future glaze experiments.

                Yay! I can finally try a new clay! I picked up Clay Art Studio's Plum Black. It should fire to ~black~ with some purplish undertones?

                        This clay feels incredible to throw with. It just listens and feels really good. These pieces are way bigger than what I throw on average and it was not a struggle
						at all. Super excited to keep throwing with this in the future!

				Ok, attempt 2 at finishing up all my remaining clay. I re-used all the clay I failed with last time Thankfully, because it got a lot of water to soak in 
				over the past couple days, it was way easier to work with. I decided to use all that clay for one piece, hopefully this one will be big enough for Max's 
				snake plant!

				Holy guacamole what a disaster throw day. I wanted to finish off the remaining Klamanth Yellow and it REFUSED to co-operate. I wired through EVERY PIECE, the
				clay got super dry and tough which also did not help. Enjoy the timelapse of me failing.

                Got to pick up what I glazed at the end of last month. I didn't do anything else, I was just really excited to see how they turned out lol.
				There are some that look really nice and some that are meh.

						I really love the pots in the first picture. The Spectrum semi-transparent glazes are super bright and pretty. The Blue Splatterware + Clear glaze worked reallly well too, 
						the bowl+handle is gonna be my perfect dessert bowl.
					</p>
					<p class="hideable">
						I did not like how the Blue Hydrangea turned out; super blotchy and weird again. I think I want to try that on a darker clay next. 
						The plate is also meh.. maybe I needed more honey flux to see the full effect of multiple glazes overlayed.

						The Honey Flux combos look AMAZING. I really like how the Green Tea + Honey Flux combo turned out. The mug is unfortunately super bottom heavy and I think I have realized
						I dont like it when a handle touches the bottom of the mug. It does not store well and feels awkward to hold. 
					</p>
					<p class="hideable">
						The final two testers turned out really cool. The Coral Pink + Honey Flux looks really neat. I'm excited finish some pieces with that.
						The semi-transparent + honey flux is interesting too, I am not sure how much I like it yet.
