						I got to pick up the first batch of pots I took time lapse videos of (back on
						Feb 19th). I used the simple white glaze on the usual Klamanth Yellow and really love how that mug turned out. It's MASSIVE (25oz!); hopefully it is big enough for Mumma's demands.

						while there I also threw a few new pots. Almost forgot to take a photo! so they are
						just under the plastic. My focus here was to give Fools Gold a second chance. 
						I tried it about a year ago and struggled with it because it is a much less malleable clay. 
						BUT, it looks gorgeous and is a very durable piece once complete. I had no problems this time!! 
						So excited to see what new stuff I can make out of it this time. Also some new shapes that can be homes for my new plants!

					Tangentially pot related; we went plant shopping! I bought a bunch of cool plants all of whom need a new pot home. These are the ones 
					that fit perfectly in my pots so far. I have a goal to make a home for all the plants bought :)

					Recorded this whole throw session in one go! I spent a few days in Seattle last week and bought
                    some funky new glazes. I'm hoping to use those for these!

					Did some throwing at home today! Cleaned up my garage and was able to use backyard hose without freezing to death! 
                    The plate is a BIG one, hoping it can be a serving platter~ there were a few more than these two but not
                    as interesting.

						I also picked up a batch of my glaze pots from the studio. I also loved how all these turned out!
                        The garlic jar lid isn't very functional so at some point I want to remake it.
